This Weather Dashboard will dynamically render the weather for any city of your choosing using the OpenWeatherAPI. By fetching the data from the Geolocating portion of the API, we were able to determine the location of the searched-city using coordinates, then render the weather of this location by feeding these coordinates to the forecast API. Then by using WEB API techniques, forecast cards were dynamically created and fed forecast data. We were also able to save the search form's input into a history button using JSON and local storage. This allowed us to store the data for previous locations, meaning if a user wants to view the forecast for a city that was already searched, they don't have to call the API again.

Would like to give a shoutout to the folks at askBCS and my tutor this week. Both were tremendously helpful in guiding me through how to extract the correct data from the APIs we used. 

Thanks for reading. Enjoy!
